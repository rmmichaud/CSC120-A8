- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class is chemist who is running a reaction. The different methods allow the chemist to start the reaction, observe the reaction, make changes like adding or removing solvent, and starting over. The chemist can also build an inventory, move things to the hood, ask for the help from the TA, and move around the lab. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I added 'startRxn' which allows the chemist to have an initial starting point to add the reactants to the flask array. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This worked well and was pretty fun to execute. I liked thinking of a scenario in my life I could use and coming up with the ideas for the methods. I wrote almost all of my code at once and then tested it afterwards. Luckily, I had no runtime errors, but there were some logic errors and such. It definitely would have been easier to test the methods one by one and fix them like that.
